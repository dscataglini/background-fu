  # The record_progress() method becomes available when your worker class includes
  # Background::WorkerMonitoring.
  #
  # Every time worker invokes record_progress() is a possible stopping place.
  #
  # How it works:
  # 1. invoke job.stop! to set a state (stopping) in a db
  # 2. Monitoring thread picks up the state change from db
  #    and sets @stopping to true in the worker.
  # 3. The worker invokes a register_progress() somewhere during execution.
  # 4. The record_progress() method throws :stopping symbol if @stopping == true
  # 5. The job catches the :stopping symbol and reacts upon it.
  # 6. The job is stopped in a merciful way. No one gets harmed.
