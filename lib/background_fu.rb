    # When multithreading is enabled, you can ask a worker to terminate a job.

    # The record_progress() method becomes available when your worker class includes
    # Background::WorkerMonitoring.
    #
    # Every time worker invokes record_progress() is a possible stopping place.
    #
    # How it works:
    # 1. invoke job.stop! to set a state (stopping) in a db
    # 2. Monitoring thread picks up the state change from db
    #    and sets @should_stop to true in the worker.
    # 3. The worker invokes a register_progress() somewhere during execution.
    # 4. The register_progress() method throws :stopped symbol if @should_stop == true
    # 5. The job catches the :stopped symbol and reacts upon it.
    # 6. The job is stopped in a merciful way. No one gets harmed.
